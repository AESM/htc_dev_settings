## Dev Settings used on my personal machine
Use what you like of it. These have treated me well.

### CAUTION
Take heed when implementing these. If you do not know what or where these files go.

**_DO NOT ATTEMPT_**

Ask a fellow developer to help you along.

These are not dotfiles and do not work for everyone out of the box.

Example:
  - Sublime user settings are dependent on several packages that you may not have installed locally.
  - Loading the wrong bash_profile for your Ruby management ENV is bad news bears.

### Backup
You should always make a backup before modifying these types of files. Better safe than sorry...

### Viewing
Tip: These files don't look great in GitHub markdown. Click raw view or download.
