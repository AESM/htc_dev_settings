### Backup
You should always make a backup before modifying these types of files. Better safe than sorry...

### Viewing
Tip: These files don't look great in GitHub markdown. Click raw view or download.

### CAUTION
Take heed when implementing these. These are not dotfiles and do not work for everyone out of the box. If you do not know what or where these files go.

**_DO NOT ATTEMPT_**

Ask a fellow developer to help you along.


Example:
  - Sublime user settings are dependent on several packages that you may not have installed locally.
  - Loading the wrong bash_profile for your Ruby management ENV is bad news bears.
