## Dev Settings used on my personal machine
At some point in the future I  hope to have time to roll these up into a pretty set of ```dotfiles```
### USE CAUTION
When implementing these settings...

Example:
  - Sublime user settings are dependent on several packages that you may not have installed locally.
  - Loading the wrong bash_profile for your Ruby management ENV is bad news bears.

### Backup
You should always make a backup before modifying these types of files. Better safe than sorry...

### Viewing
Tip: These files don't look great in GitHub markdown. Click raw view or download.
