## Dev Settings used on my personal machine
At some point in the future I  hope to have time to roll these up into a pretty set of ```dotfiles```
### USE CAUTION
When implementing these settings... For instance the sublime user settings are dependent on several packages that you may not have installed locally.

### Backup
You should always make a backup before modifying these types of files. Better safe than sorry...
